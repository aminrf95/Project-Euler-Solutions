#Problem 4:
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#Approach 1: We can solve this problem by simply iterating through all tuples (i,j) where 99 < i, j < 1000, and checking if i * j
#is a palindrome, while keeping track of the maximum-value palindrome seen thus far.

#Checks if the string s is a palindrome

    return True
